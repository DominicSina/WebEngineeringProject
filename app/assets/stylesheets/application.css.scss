 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or any plugin's vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.

 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS/SCSS
 * files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
 * It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.

// Example using 'Cerulean' bootswatch

//Import bootstrap-sprockets
@import "bootstrap-sprockets";

// Import cerulean variables
@import "bootswatch/readable/variables";

// Then bootstrap itself
@import "bootstrap";

/*adds a padding so the navbar doesn't overlap.
*/
body {
  padding-top: 80px;
}
/*same for responsive bootstrap, hm doesn't seem to do anything though, is it only for mobile?
*/
@media (max-width: 979px) {
  body {
    padding-top: 0px;
  }
}

// And finally bootswatch style itself
@import "bootswatch/cerulean/bootswatch";

// Whatever application styles you have go last
//@import "base";
